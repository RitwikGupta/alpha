# CoronaCurves -- version01

This software attempts to generate visualizations of epidemic and hospital data that leaders can quickly assimilate and use in making effective decisions.

CoronaCurves is easy to set up and run out of the box.  It is not, however, configured to be easily customizable.  If you want different functions you will have to get dirty with the Python code.  Feel free to fork this repository.

Ultimately, getting good data and understanding its baked-in assumptions will be your most difficult task.  That is as it should be.
